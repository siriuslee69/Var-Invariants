## | Every routine here says something a signature cannot say, and  |

## |                                                                |
## |   withdraw   a promise on the way in, and one on the way out   |
## |   classify   a promise that survives an early `return`         |
## |   isSorted   a promise about every item at once                |
## |   push       a promise about the value something used to have  |
## |   trim       a promise checked at both ends, not just one      |
## |   drain      a promise the running program carries too         |
