## The names, and why they are not the obvious ones
## ------------------------------------------------
## The obvious names are taken. `requires` and `ensures` are pragmas
## the Nim compiler already knows: they belong to DrNim, a separate
## build of the compiler that proves them with a solver. The ordinary
## compiler reads them, checks that what is written makes sense, and
## then does nothing with it.
##
## That is the worst possible middle ground for a promise. It looks
## checked. It compiles. Nothing is enforced, and nobody is told. So
## these are called something else, and a promise written with one of
## these names is a promise that is actually kept:
##
##   requires/ensures   the compiler's own. Read, then ignored.
##   needs/gives/keeps  this file's. Checked.
##
## Two tiers, and the difference is where the check happens
## -------------------------------------------------------
##
##   needs / gives / keeps          checked while building
##   needsRun / givesRun / keepsRun checked while building
##                                           AND while running
##
## The first three cost **nothing**. Not "almost nothing" - the check
## sits inside `when nimvm:`, a branch the compiler keeps for its own
## interpreter and never writes into the program. A repository that
## imports this and uses those three has a binary of exactly the size
## it had before. There is a test that compiles two programs and
## compares their sizes, because a promise like that is worth pinning
## down.
##
## So when does a build-time check actually run?
## --------------------------------------------
## Whenever the compiler itself runs the routine. That happens in a
## `const`, inside a `static:` block, and inside any macro:
##
##     static:
##       discard withdraw(100, 40)     <- checked, and passes
##       discard withdraw(40, 100)     <- the build stops here
##
## This is worth being plain about: a routine only called at run time
## is never checked by the first three. That is what the `Run` three
## are for. The two are meant to be used together - name the promise
## once with `needsRun`, get it checked in tests that run at build
## time and again in the program.
##
## Turning the running checks off
## ------------------------------
##
##   normal build       checks are on
##   -d:danger          off
##   -d:noVowContracts  off
##   -d:vowContracts    on, whatever else was said
##
## Saying it about many values at once
## -----------------------------------
##
##     gives: forall(i in 1 ..< A.len, A[i - 1] <= A[i])
##     needs: exists(c in s, c == '=')
##
## `forall` is true when the second part holds for every one; `exists`
## when it holds for at least one. Both are ordinary expressions, so
## they work in either tier and can be joined with `and` and `or`.
##
## Talking about the value something had on the way in
## --------------------------------------------------
##
##     proc take(S: var Stack, n: int) {.
##       givesRun: S.len == old(S).len - n
##     .} = ...
##
## `old(x)` is the value `x` held when the routine started. It costs
## one copy, so it is only kept for the `Run` tier, where a copy was
## already being paid for.
##
## What `gives` had to do to your body, and the one case to watch
## ----------------------------------------------------------------
## A `gives` check has to happen after everything, including after
## an early `return`. So the body is wrapped in a block and every
## `return` in it is rewritten:
##
##     return x        becomes    result = x
##                                break vowContractBody
##
## A `return` inside a closure written inside the body is left alone,
## because that one returns from the closure. The rewrite does not
## reach into a nested routine of any kind.
##
## The body's last line is looked at once: if it is an expression the
## routine could return, it becomes `result = <it>`. The compiler
## decides that, not this file, through `when compiles(result = ...)`.
## The one case to watch is a last line that calls something marked
## `{.discardable.}` whose type happens to match: that value now
## becomes the result, where before it was thrown away.
